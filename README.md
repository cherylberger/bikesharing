# BikeSharing - Module 14 Tableau
### Cheryl Berger

## Overview
Use the data from the NYC bikesharing program to generate several visualizations for the investors of a similar program for the city of Des Moines, Iowa. The data reviewed so far has been useful and most are ready to sign.  However, one of the key stakeholders would like to see an analysis of the bike trips to better before making the investment. The company has provided access to Tabelau software to generate the visualizations and we will use Pandas to perform a data conversion to aid in the analysis.

### Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

The visulizations created in Deliverable 2 were added to a Tableau Story for ease of review with stakeholders.  Two additional graphs from the lesson were recreated using the citibikes.csv datafile.

    **A pie chart containing the ride count by gender was added to the story.**

    **An area chart containing the ride count by birth year was also added to the story to illustrate rides by age**

## Summary
Judging by the data analyzed above, bike-sharing services are popular among all genders in busy metropolitan areas.  This may be due to the number of tourists, the denseness of traffic on the roads, or availability of parking. The most popular time to use the bike-sharing service is in the late afternoon and early evening. While we have a lot of good information here, there are more analysis that could be performed:

Due to the high population density in the urban capital of the state of Iowa, the results suggest the investment in the bikesharing program is likey to be a success in DesMoines.  

### Additional Viz 1
An analysis of usage of ride-sharing services in the winter should be performed to determine if the investment is worthwhile all year long? Will Iowans still use the bikes if temperatures are low and there is snow and ice on the bikeway? How would the seasonal reduction in ridership affect the investors?

### Additional Viz 2
There may be some hidden costs in bicyle maitenance and repair that are not discussed in the current analysis.  It would be interesting to know the average service life of the bicycle or even the frequency of repairs. The cost to keep the bicycles in service for use in the ride-sharing program may aid in determining the total amount of cash flow the company needs to maintain in order to maintain service levels.
