# BikeSharing - Module 14 Tableau
### Cheryl Berger

## Overview
Use the data from the NYC bikesharing program to generate several visualizations for the investors of a similar program for the city of Des Moines, Iowa. The data reviewed so far has been useful and most are ready to sign.  However, one of the key stakeholders would like to see an analysis of the bike trips to better before making the investment. The company has provided access to Tabelau software to generate the visualizations and we will use Pandas to perform a data conversion to aid in the analysis.
